                  <p><b>Security hygiene</b></p>
                  <p>Maybe it's a given, yet encryption will not assist with somebody who has actual admittance to your opened telephone. In the event that you haven't done as such, secret key ensure your gadget. Exit WhatsApp and turn on your password. </p>
